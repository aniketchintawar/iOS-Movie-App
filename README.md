# iOS-Movie-App
An iOS Movie App built using Swift and UIKit, showcasing movie posters in a horizontally scrolling collection view with page control. Users can search movies by name, view filtered results in a table view, and enjoy a clean, responsive UI. Features include custom cells, dismissable keyboard, and gesture support. Future improvements planned.
